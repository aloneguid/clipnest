Perform most common string operations on the clipboard like word length, base64 encoding, md5, sha256 hashes and so on with ease. Missing an operation? Raise an issue here and myself or any willing contributor will make it happen. You are welcome to contribute the code as well! See [official page](https://www.aloneguid.uk/projects/clipnest/) for details and instructions how to use it. This github page hosts source code and issues only.

To **build**, you need `cmake` and `C++ 20` and all the build steps are "documented" in github workflow file.

All **contributions** and feature requests are welcome. Donations are more than welcome to keep this going forward.
